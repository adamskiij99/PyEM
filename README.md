Easily generate sample paths of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using the Euler-Maruyama method.
This is meant to be a tool to help understand intuitively the behaviour of sample paths of SDEs. With a little tweaking (e.g. 5000 sample paths and setting high transparency of samples in the plot) you should also be able to gauge the approximate evolution of the probability density.
The default SDEs in the code are those defining the Heston model, a typical stochastic volatility model used in mathematical finance.
